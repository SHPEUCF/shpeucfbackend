# Introduction
Thank you for considering contributing to the SHPE UCF back end! It is thanks to our members that we have been able to push this project through.

# Your First Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by contacting the Tech Director (Developer) or going through the [Issues](https://github.com/SHPEUCF/shpeucfbackend/issues).

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help, SHPE is always here to help.

# Getting started
To start contributing:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Once you are happy with your changes:
	* Be sure you have followed the code style by ESLint for the project
	* Start a pull request and follow the template given

That's it! All you have to do is wait for review.

# How to report a bug
When filing an issue, make sure to answer the questions on the **Bug report** template and address the issue carefully.

General questions should be asked on the Slack #tech channel, where any one of our members will answer you.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, feel free to add it using the **Feature request** template. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub and make sure it follows the feature template.

# Code review process
The developers of the Tech Committee will take a look at the pull request, in the order in which they were submitted. They will check mainly for code styling and organization, as it will not be possible to test functionality for multiple pull requests at a time. If approved and there are no conflicts, it will be merged to the master branch. In case of conflicts, the reviewer may request you to merge those conflicts and update your pull request. If not approved, the reviewer will have added the reason, after which you may continue working on the pull request for future approval.

# Code styling
Make sure to follow all the specifications of the linter (ESLint) found on [.eslintrc.yml](../functions/.eslintrc.yml). If you don't want to manually take care of these issues, download the ESLint plugin to your code editor of choice ([Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint), [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ESLint)), where it can take care of them automatically.
